# UI - Redesign

I decided to use the suggested website italia.is

### Figma file

### Colors
I knew I was looking for colors that work with/as the Italy flag colors so I found a color pallet that I liked on [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/004411-396b35-910b0b-b5672b-d8cbaf)

### Font
I selected Helvetica, I think it looks nice and clean.

### Guide
I set up kind of a style guide for color and font on the mood board to have a reference to font sizes and colors to use throughout the project

### Logo
I didn't find the logo in a high resolution so I decided as a practice in figma to recreate it there, I think that went well.

### Content
I mostly used content from the exsiting site but changed somethings and re-used some things in the menu for example to save time.

### Prototyping
I set up some interactive prototyping to see the website in action, it's possible to go from "HOME" to "MENU" and back, it's also possible to browse the menu both "Forréttir" and "Pastaréttir".
