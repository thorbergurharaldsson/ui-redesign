# UI - Redesign

I decided to use the suggested website italia.is

### Figma file

### Colors:
I knew I was looking for colors that work with/as the Italy flag colors so I found a color pallet that I liked on [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/004411-396b35-910b0b-b5672b-d8cbaf)

### Logo
I didn't find the logo in a high resolution so I decided as a practis in figma to recreate it there, I went okay.  I didn't end up using that logo tho since I feel there is way to much going on in it and did not find a good place on the site where it would have looked good, I also would not look good on smaller screens since it is so detailed
